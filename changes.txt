Warren custom libs v1.0.9 changes
	- A bug in the 'boxEvents.h' and 'boxEvents.cpp' has been fixed (the size of alpha characters was set with "'z' - 'a'" which
		sets the size to 25 whereas the good value must be 26 ).
	
Warren custom libs v1.0.8 changes
	- A new library ('graphicalTextParagraph') has been added. Its purpose is to display a text with a given paragraph width
		with a text coming from a file whether the text file is formatted or not ( i.e for example the text file has its words
		on the same line and separated by sapces you finally got a text block in your game/application window).

Warren custom libs v1.0.7 changes
	- A new library ('joystickTests') has been added, particulary for the 0.1.11 version of my game 'Bob the blob'. This library
		purpose is to have an interface to get informations (hats, axes and buttons number) about the first plugged joystick. It
		also provides calibration of the joystick.

Warren custom libs v1.0.6 changes
	- The main CMakeLists.txt file has been modified, the line 8 doesn't contain the word 'BOOL' anymore, which led to a bug when
		the 'USE_WX_WIDGETS_FRAMEWORK' value was set to OFF, cmake even searched the wxWidgets framework whereas the user of the 
		libraries explicitly told cmake to not search/use it in the configuration/compilation process.
	
Warren custom libs v1.0.5 changes
	- According to the use of theses libraries, the wxWidgets framework is no longer mandatory (see from line 5 to 8 of the main
		CMakeLists.txt file for more explanations). You can choose a build without wxWidgets dependency.
		For example the games 'Bob the blob' and 'SDL2_WarrenTetris' don't need wxWidgets at all. However in Breakout4, this is
		optional and only necessary if you want to build the saves editor and the level editor, the game executable don't need it. 

Warren custom libs v1.0.4 changes
	- Added a function 'void setAllCoordinates(const TexturePosition& position);' in the "constAnimationDrawing.h" class.

Warren custom libs v1.0.3 changes
	- Added an 'else' condition in case of input stream error at line number 86 of 'animFileTextures.cpp' (see sdl2_wrapper
		library in 'sources/advancedDrawing/texturesLoading/' directory

Warren custom libs v1.0.2 changes
	- Added the cmakeModules directory needed to compile the libraries.

Warren custom libs v1.0.1 changes
	- Added a constructor to 'sdl2::MixerModule' (in sdl2_wrapper library and 'sources/initialization/sdl2MixerInit.h' file)
		in which you can supply a custom number of channels, the default channels number is 22 like before.
	- Some private variables of the sdl2::JoystickEntity class have been renamed (the underscores have been removed). See in
		sdl2_wrapper library and 'sources/joystick/joystickEntity.h' file.
