Warren custom libs v1.0.5 changes
	- According to the use of theses libraries, the wxWidgets framework is no longer mandatory (see from line 5 to 8 of the main
		CMakeLists.txt file for more explanations). You can choose a build without wxWidgets dependency.
		For example the games 'Bob the blob' and 'SDL2_WarrenTetris' don't need wxWidgets at all. However in Breakout4, this is
		optional and only necessary if you want to build the saves editor and the level editor, the game executable don't need it.

Warren custom libs v1.0.1 changes
	- Added a constructor to 'sdl2::MixerModule' (in sdl2_wrapper library and 'sources/initialization/sdl2MixerInit.h' file)
		in which you can supply a custom number of channels, the default channels number is 22 like before.
	- Some private variables of the sdl2::JoystickEntity class have been renamed (the underscores have been removed). See in
		sdl2_wrapper library and 'sources/joystick/joystickEntity.h' file.
