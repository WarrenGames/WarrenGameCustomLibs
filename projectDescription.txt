WarrenGames customÂ libs v1.0.9

This github repository only contains libraries written with the C++ 
language which purpose is to help you build the games from the 
WarrenGames github account which you can reach at this address:
https://github.com/WarrenGames.

That said, I made an effort so that code source compilation can be 
convenient and there are branches that don't need this library pack,
but only 'SDL2' and optionally 'wxWidgets' framework as dependencies,
since some of theses libraries are included already in the game source 
code.

You can use these libraries as SDL2 wrapper or else for any purpose 
(including commercial) separatly from my projects/repositories. 
The dependencies of this repository are the SDL2 and wxWidgets and 
they can be used for commercial projects but a mention of the use of
theses libraries is wished but not mandatory.
